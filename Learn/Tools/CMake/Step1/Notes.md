# Notes - CMake Step 1

## cli works well

```bash
cmake .
make
```

## vscode cmake configure does not work. why?

vscode does not make progress after displaying "... configuring...".
go with cli for now. maybe forever. live with keyboard. 

After restarting codespace several times, configuration works. Why?
