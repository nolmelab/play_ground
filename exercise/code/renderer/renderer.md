# renderer

While doing exercises on collision and navimesh integration, a need to build
or use a simple renderer is required. 

To achieve this, some research is necessary.

## a c++ tiny renderer

Finish the tinyrenderer course in 3 days.


## use glm

design renderer interface. Look at software opengl renderer.


## software opengl renderer

Mesa or else. 

- https://github.com/keith2018/SoftGLRender/tree/main
  - has opengl, vulkan, sofware renderers
  - a very simple interface to draw

- mesa seems to be too big to follow, but tempting

- https://github.com/zauonlok/renderer
  - this is pure software renderer
  - which seems to be the best in 10 min search
