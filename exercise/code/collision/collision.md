# collision 

- experiment with:
  - detour and bulletphysics
  - integrate detour navigation mesh into bulletphysics 
  - measure performance 

## steps

- [1] understand how bulletphysics handles triangle mesh for collision detection including concave one
- [2] import navigation mesh into bulletphysics and check collision detection performance
- [3] understand detour navigation mesh structure 
  - [3.1] estimate whether navimesh convex split is required
